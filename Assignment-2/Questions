Cuckoo hashing is a scheme in computer programming for resolving hash collisions of values of hash functions in a table, with worst-case constant lookup time.

Implementation of Cuckoo Hashing:

To Implement Cuckoo Hashing We need to create 

Module-1: this module will output two tables on a specific output, these two tables will have already some values stored.
Module-2: This module will generate data of values with their corresponding indexes in two tables.
Module-3: This is Top module file this will use the other two and will insert new value.
